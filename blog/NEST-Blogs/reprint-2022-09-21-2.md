# A STORY BETWEEN NEST PROTOCOL & MYSELF

## ABOUT NEST PROTOCOL
NEST ingeniously uses a decentralized oracle to introduce random information flow and tokenism random information flow using the OMM mechanism, creating a large number of stochastic assets.

Based on fundamental operations, the NEST probabilistic virtual machine PVM can program stochastic assets, which is applicable to a wide range of real-world situations. As a result of the system supply converging due to an inbuilt cost mechanism, a new universal coin with an innate logic of price appreciation is created.

A unique new resource for the blockchain industry, the NEST currency offers a completely new development tool.

However, Ethereum also has a downside: all asset information is de-terministic (xis a deterministic variable). If we want x to be a random variable X, that is, the result of a random event determines the value of this variable X, it is uncertain before the occurrence of this random event,and we only have information about its distribution at most. In addition,Xis introduced into programming and calculation to obtain this random variable’s functional value F(x). Note thatF(X)itself is also a random variable, which is beyond the reach of the current EVM mechanism.

## HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND NEST WHITEPAPER
How do we incorporate random information and random information flow into the chain given that informationized assets and informationized asset program-ming are now a reality thanks to blockchain technology and Ethereum, as discussed in the previous chapter.


**Stochastic Asset**

When a random variable X is kept at a certain address, such as A, it signifies that address A is able to connect at a later time in accordance with the distribution of X. This link can be either data or value: for instance, when X equals a specific value x, the address will contain x units of an asset (a token). Tokenization of random variables is the name given to this value-based relationship. The system can identify a tokenized random variable as a stochastic asset by appending the token’s unit name to the random variable. Because there are a finite number of ETH tokens, tokenizing random variables is not possible because this would constrain the range of values that can be assigned to the random variable. Taking as an illustration a stochastic with a 1 in 1 billion chance.

It is undeniable that Ethereum performs a wide range of crucial tasks for the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem’s future, however this fantastic technology (EVM) nevertheless falls short in one key area.
ETH is a functional and informational asset, but due to the 100 million ETH that will ultimately be made available, its potential for future revenue streams is limited. A stochastic asset with infinite and continuous value is the NEST token, though. This indicates that the challenge of adding random variables and distribution modification for on-chain programming has been overcome.

**Computer Stochastic**

What this essentially means is that instead of solving the problem of asset value using arithmetic techniques like the EVM, it can be done using probabilistic techniques (PVM). This effectively expands the boundary of the EVM and significantly speeds up the development process of some financial products.

Let’s move on to the article’s interesting next section, which discusses the NEST currency and its use.
The NEST coin is substantially more sophisticated than the typical information assets found in the crypto ecosystem. Knowledge of basic economics demonstrates that the rule of supply and demand has a significant impact on the price of any coin, but when it comes to the NEST coin, this is not the case.

**PVM**

It is well known, particularly among crypto aficionados, that the majority of smart contracts are executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is so because the EVM functions like a mathematical function, which means that given an input, it generates a deterministic output.
To process any high-end computing information, the NEST protocol uses a different sort of machine known as the PVM. This machine functions as a distributed computing architecture from a probabilistic connected system that functions as a single unit. It differs significantly from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is operated by hundreds of connected computers running an Ethereum client.

## NEST COIN AND ITS USAGE

NEST 4.4 is the most recent version of the software.
When compared to earlier versions, NEST4.4 has the following new features:

•Better methods: One can now start the price information flow for more than ten different assets in a single smartcontract, allowing for the price offering of several assets.
Gas costs can be significantly reduced in this method.
Information uploading now works much more effectively.

•Improved economic models: cancel the quotation commission fee. It is currently also free to call the quotation pricing from NEST.
The mint production has since been cut in half, to 1/6 of what it was.
The rate of circulation growth is less than 3% each year.
These modifications will eventually ensure that NEST’s value will rise.
NEST won’t number more than 3,000,000,000 in total (3billion).
The pricing information offering threshold is only lower.

## Participants in the NEST protocol are as below:

**Price Makers**: The participants who submit price quotations to the protocol.This includes miners who quote prices for mining and verifiers who completethe transaction and quotation.–Miners: Providing quotations to receive NEST (ERC-20 Token). Minersare denoted asO, and anyone can become a miner.

**Verifiers**: If the quotation price deviates from the market price, the verifiercan trade a quoted asset at the quoted price to earn revenue. The verifierneeds to “force” a quotation at the time of the transaction and does notneed to pay a commission nor participate in mining. Verifiers are denotedasA, and anyone can become a verifier.

**Price Callers**: The contract or account that “calls” the NEST protocol quota-tions and pays the fee is called a price caller. Price callers are denoted asC.Any contract or account can become a price caller, but this will generally bereserved for other DeFi protocols and institutions

## Applications

**Derivatives**: Futures and options are the most direct beneficiaries ofthe NEST system. Since the contract is the only seller, the crore-sponding derivatives can be offered as long as the demand parameter sand the corresponding expected values are provided. For example, if someone needs a call option based on ETH/USDT, the strike price and strike date need to be entered to get the cost calculable, and the option can be exercised at expiration according to the conditions set.

**Parallel Asset/ Stable coins**: Based on the price system, parallel assets representing arbitrary price information flow can be generated, and their earnings are consistent with the original assets. For example,PBTC, PUSD, P ETH, etc., the flow of price information generated in this way can be duplicated by collate ralizing the NEST or the assets accepted by the system, or it can be produced based on the cover-gence algorithm (supported by the system’s interest rate oracle), but the cost paid must be guaranteed to match the generated assets.

**Bond and interest rate oracle**:The system can create an endogenous bond reflecting the time value of NEST that responds to the overall supply and demand , which can also be understood as an interest rate oracle. The interest rate is a system-level variable

**NEST’S APPLICATION (FUTURES,OPTIONS,WIN,ORACLE)**
HERE IS SOME APPLICATION OF NEST’S APPLICATIONS AND THERE FUTURES,OPTIONS, HOW TO WIN & ORACLE.

1) **Futures**: A futures contract is an agreement to buy and sell an asset at a fixed price at a specific future date; however, the price of the NEST item at that day will be probabilistic.

2) **Alternative**: Using a probabilistic virtual machine technique, investors will be able to speculatively predict the price of the NEST coin in the future.

3) **Win**: If you play the games at least five times, you can collect rewards, and if you win, you can withdraw your winnings to the wallet address of your choice.

4) **Oracle**: Essential features of Nests oracle are as follows: First, it isentirely permission less and open to quotation, so anyone can participate in the quotation and form a price on the chain. The second is on-chain verification. NEST prices must be verified on-chain rather than off-chain,which is the key to Nests design. NEST is designed based on security and robustness, which enables everyone to change and influence the generation of prices on the chain. At the same time, it makes the price information converge to the equilibrium price under the protection of the mechanism. Nests offering for the price oracle involves arbitrage and the inclusion of collateral asset quote.

The entire NEST protocol is made up of modules for verification, price chain, beta coefficients, and other components.

From everything we’ve covered in this post, it’s evident that NEST’s innovative approaches to some of the shortcomings of mainstream blockchain technology, such the use of probabilistic virtual machines,

Stochastic assets can be programmed by a machine using PVM, which can be used to many different real-world settings. These new developments will raise the price of the NEST currency to unimaginable heights.

## Oracle price data must meet the following key requirements:

**Accuracy**: The price data on the oracle should truly reflect the market price.

**Price sensitivity**: The price data on the oracle should react fast enough to market movements.

**Attack resistance**: The cost of distorting or affecting the real price is extremely high for any attackers.

**Direct verification**: The verifier can be any third party, and no centralized review or threshold is required.

**Distributed quotation system**: no centralized review or threshold is required,and anyone can freely join or leave at any place and at any time.

## FUTURE OF NEST PROTOCOL
Today I will discuss the NEST Protocol Price Prediction for 2022, 2025 and 2030 based on the below notion. The price of a cryptocurrency is one of the most important factors to consider.

Cryptocurrencies have been a big hit and, at the same time for some users, a loss situation paradigm. So, traders and investors always looking for forecast prices down to the smallest detail and want to know the answers of these frequently asked questions, Is NEST Protocol (NEST) a good investment? how much will NEST Protocol be worth in 2025 or how much will NEST Protocol be worth in 10 years.Investing in any crypto on a long and short-term basis will be discussed deeply.

## NEST Protocol Price Prediction
**NEST Protocol Price Prediction 2022**

Volatility drives the cryptocurrency market. Today, it is not easy to forecast and keep up with the current pricing. Many crypto analysts come into play in this regard. The pricing forecasts are correct for the mentioned years. Crypto consumers are still concerned about the crypto bans and new restrictions.
