# Notification some adjustments of NEST protocol contract 

**Due to The Ethereum Merge and the acquisition of Huobi, we have made the following adjustments to the NEST protocol on ETH to offset its impact:**

1. Update the contract of NEST protocol
   - Adjust the block time to 12090 milliseconds, and the blocks per year to 2600000.
   - Adjust 3 field names in the structure of PriceSheet: remainNum to remainScales, ethNumBal to token0Scales, tokenNumBal to token1Scales. The meaning of the field does not change.
   - Add an interface for updating the channel token address: updateToken.
   - Delete 2 interfaces: totalETHRewards, donate.
   
2. Adjust the amount of mining reward per block in No.0 quotation channel, from 24 to 20.

3. Adjust the address in No.0 quotation channel, from HBTC to PBTC(0x102E6BBb1eBfe2305Ee6B9E9fd5547d0d39CE3B4).
